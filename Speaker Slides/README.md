# Camp Counselors

First and foremost, THANK YOU for being part of THAT Conference.

We're not interested in messing with your creative freedom, so rather than asking you to use a template deck, we're just asking you to include a few slides in your presentation. You will find the following in the exports folder:

## Important Slides
* Sponsors - Please display this and thank our sponsors for making THAT Conference possible.
* Save_the_Date - You know how you have to say something 7 times before someone really listens, we're just trying to say something 130 times so people will save the date ;)
* Session_Survey_Speaker - In email I included a link to your session's QR code. That QR code will pre-populate the session survey with your session title.
* Session_Survey - Just an example, but if for some reason your QR code didn't work, this is a QR code that doesn't pre-populate the same survey as above.

## Fun Slides
* THAT_Conference.png - Just a simple slide with our logo if you'd like a placeholder slide for anything.
* Simple_Footer.png - Just a simple layout if you'd like.
* Footer_With_Landscape.png - Just a not-so-simple layout if you'd like.

Each image is sized to precisely 1920x1080 guaranteeing an exact presentation match with perfect placement.

I can't wait to see you at THAT Conference, and if you need anything, please feel free to reach out or text me at 847-921-7467.

Best of luck with your session.
